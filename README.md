Deep Blue Parts
============

Deep Blue Parts is a web-based system for tracking parts through the design and manufacture cycle. It assigns
part numbers with which CAD files can be saved to version control and stores information about parts'
current manufacturing status.

Deep Blue Parts is written in Ruby using the [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) framework and uses MySQL as the
backing datastore. Development and production are run on UNIX (OS X and Ubuntu), so there are no guarantees
it'll work on Windows, sorry.

Deep Blue Parts is built on Cheesy Parts, a wonderful tool written by Pat Fairbank at [Team 254](https://github.com/Team254).

## Team 199 Specific Features

Our fork differs from 254's in a few ways:

1. Users can edit their own account settings, including passwords, names, and one of several stylesheets.
1. Workflow, status options, and other attributes are generally optimized for our team's resources.
1. Secure file upload is added so that members with edit privileges may upload drawings, documentation, and toolpath files. Each part and assembly carries revision letters that are automatically managed by the program. Lite version control is offered, with the ability to restore previous revisions if user is an administrator.
1. Slack and Trello integeration is offered, since our team uses both tools for communication and task tracking.
1. Additional dashboards and reports are offered for use.
1. DBP has been rewritten for compatibility with bootstrap 4.

## Planned Additions
1. Redesigned ordering interface
1. Mattermost bot integration
1. Interface for use of COTS parts in assemblies
1. Integration with GrabCAD or SW PDM

## Development

Prerequisites:

* Ruby 2.3 and development packages
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com)
* MySQL and development packages
* g++ for installation of some dev packages (optional)

To run Deep Blue Parts locally:

1. Create an empty MySQL database and a user account with full permissions on it.
1. Populate `config.json` with the parameters for the development and production environments. Set
`enable_wordpress_auth` to false and `members_url` to blank; they are used for a single sign-on (SSO)
mechanism specific to Team 254. Make sure to add your Slack and Trello API tokens if using those features.
1. Run `bundle install`. This will download and install the gems that Deep Blue Parts depends on.
1. Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate`. This will run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in
MySQL.
1. Run `ruby parts_server_control.rb <command>` to control the running of the Deep Blue Parts server, where
`<command>` can be one of `start`|`stop`|`run`|`restart`.

The database migration will create an admin account (username "deleteme@team199.org", password "shark-tank")
that you can use to first get into the system and create other accounts. It is highly recommended that you
delete this account after having created your own admin account.

Uploads are stored in `uploads/` and at this time can only be directly managed by logging into your server.
